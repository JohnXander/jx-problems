# Welcome to JX Problems

This project was inspired by the Boolean UK repo: [JS Problems](https://github.com/boolean-uk/js-problems) <br>
- The original repo stood for "Javascript Problems"
- This repo stands for "John Xander's Problems" <br>
(as all the problems you will find in this repo are my original creations)
