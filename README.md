# Welcome to JX Problems 💻

🎓 **This project was inspired by the Boolean UK repo:** [JS Problems](https://github.com/boolean-uk/js-problems) <br>
- The original repo stood for "JavaScript Problems", whereas this repo stands for "JohnXander Problems" <br>
(as all the problems were designed by myself in order to practise different parts of JavaScript).

📁 **Each folder in `src` will contain the following:**
1. A `README.md` file outlining the problem.
2. A `solution.js` file with the starting code.

🧪 **Each problem also has its own set of tests in the `spec` folder.**
- You can run `npx jasmine` to check if your solutions are passing the tests.
