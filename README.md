# Welcome to JX Problems

> This project was inspired by the Boolean UK repo: [JS Problems](https://github.com/boolean-uk/js-problems) <br>
- The original repo stood for "Javascript Problems"
- This repo stands for "John Xander's Problems" <br>
(as all the problems you will find in this repo are my original creations)

> Each folder in `src` will contain the following:
1. A `problem.md` file outlining the problem.
2. A `solution.js` file with the starting code.
